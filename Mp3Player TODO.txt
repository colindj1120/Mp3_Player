TODO:

implement multi sort search


change add group in playlist menu item to add playlist group
implement adding songs to playlists

implement deleting songs

implement edit songs (not just xml but actual files)


different way to control system volume current one doesn't give wide range?



test searching while song is playing and then have song end after you get rid of all search parameters and see if song will go to next song

run more testing on previous button (compare to itunes w/ shuffle w/o shuffle etc)

add in a check for .mp3 file not found
